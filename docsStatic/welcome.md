Thanks for trying the alt:V IDE Extension. We have added our most important links below to get you started with development for alt:V. Please check them out below and make sure you read the original extensions `README` file to fully understand how this extension works.

_You may be seeing this page if the extension just updated_

## üìù Getting Started

You should check out the bootcamp by clicking `Open alt:V Docs` at the bottom!

Feel free to search through the documentation that way.

## üí≠ Use the Status Bar to Search

After getting your environment setup you can simply click `Open alt:V Docs` in the status bar at the bottom of the IDE to start browsing documentation. You can also hit `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and then type `alt:V Documentation` to search documentation.

If you don't see `Open alt:V Docs` you will need to setup your environment first.

## üí≠ Support this Extension?

There's a handful of ways you can contribute or assist with this extension. This extension is meant to assist with development and teach new developers concepts inside of GTA:V. All of the documentation writtein here is in `.md` format so it makes it accessible for VSCode but also allows for other software like Docusaurus, VuePress, etc. to easily work with the `.md` files.
